            <p>My name is Dinh Ngoc Quynh and my sID is s3757193. I am a senior at RMIT studying International Business and Digital Marketing as major and minor, respectively. I am an extrovert who is friendly, humorous, open-minded and energetic. Besides, I also like making new friends and broadening my social circle to observe and learn from several people from different backgrounds as I find it interesting to comprehend others’ personality and feelings. I acknowledge myself as a good listener and advisor, thus, having various connections will help me enrich my experiences and perspective in dealing with circumstances. I had joined RMIT Vietnam Business Club and RMIT Vietnam Student Council and it has supported my college as well as my personal life a lot. At first, I never thought I would engage in any IT course since I believed IT is only writing code. However, after talking with my friends, I realised that SQL is one of the useful tools for business data management and decided to join a basic course in Linkedin which was quite enjoyable for me. Another example is about the personalised digital ads on Google and Facebook and digital marketing coursesI joined in RMIT such as Digital Business Development, which is about SEM, running ads and so on, that triggered my curiosity about AI and IT in general. Despite having no knowledge in the IT field, I hope to learn anything I can to support my career

            <h3>Ngo Khai Hung - s3819675</h3>
            <p>My name is Ngo Khai Hung and my student number is 3819675. I'm a first-year student at RMIT and my major is IT. Before enrolling in RMIT, I used to have a hard time making up my decision and often close my heart to others when my personality has majorly changed. My first encounter with IT is from games where you need to cooperate with strangers to achieve the goal of winning. That's when I put my mind to IT and from then I'm hoping that my future job is within the Information Technology industry. My enrolment was in 2019 when the first strike of Covid-19 entered VN, I had to take a break for 2 years to stabilise my family's finance, and also challenge myself with a side job as electrical refrigeration to experience how adulthood functions, collecting small pennies to fulfil an empty stomach, from then I have put myself in a position of working harder to avoid working menace labour job. IT is new to even me and even my family but, how they encouraged me to follow this path have made me realise how IT can change my life for the best and I'm hoping to learn more to complete my first task of mastering a programming language to further help me obtain my career in the future.

            <h3>Nguyen Duc Thang - s3921992</h3>
            <p>My name is Nguyen Duc Thang and my student ID is s3921992. I’m also a first-year RMIT student like everyone else in my group. Still, a bit that makes me different from other students is that I already have a background in another degree of economics. Still, I chose RMIT with the major of IT right at the end of my studies in FTU, and the reason for that is I wish to dig deeper into the field of A.I, so as to build my own machine that can calculate the flow of future economy. That is my dream. Still, my current goal is to learn and develop for myself a lifestyle that benefits my studies as much and as efficiently as possible, so that I can still keep myself always keeping track of all the new updates around me. However, as a human being, recreational activities are still needed, and I have chosen games as a way to relax myself, since playing a variety of games is also a way for me to see other developers’ ideas and enhance my own creativity. I’m hoping for a great start at RMIT as an IT freshman and even a brighter future waiting for me when I have earned my rightful place in my own company.

        <h1>Group Processes</h1>
        <p>Week 8:</p>
        <p>We met each other and discussed the assignment’s structure as well as studied each other’s strengths and weaknesses. We have also achieved the first stage of getting to know our team members, including the way people talk, how they work and the way to contact each other efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>Then we are to do research about the upcoming topic so that in the next meeting, we can decide which idea we can use in the future.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>Week 9:</p>
        <p>We have gathered our original ideas as well as taken some great ideas on the internet as a way to compare to our current existing pool of ideas. Then we narrow down each idea until we get the final one
        </p>
        <p>Since our first meeting and our preparation at home were successful,we managed to pin down the main concept of our project to be in servings of clothes suggestions in only this meeting.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>Week 10: </p>
        <p>We have made a plan of the work during the meeting, then we decide each person’s work, allocate the team’s main focus so as to efficiently work through the process in the minimum time and effort.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>Week 11:</p>
        <p>Using the Drive and github and Canva and every online tool available, we managed to create a system of writing and checking for errors simutanously in each day: morning we write, and at night we can comment on the changes we have made. This process has been done everyday since the day we have made our plans.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>Week 12:</p>
        <p>After countless addings and fixings and comments everyday, we have managed to get ourselves a finalised product of the report, a website, a slideshow and finished our preparations for the demonstration day.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>Overall:</p>
        <p>In the first meeting to get to know each other and discuss the assignment’s structure, we quickly opened up and introduced ourselves as new friends. It was a smooth and comfortable meeting since we were all communicative, active in raising ideas and willing to listen to each other’s opinions and give feedback. Although everyone had different assignments and due dates, we tried to arrange the time as well as planned an agenda and prepared for the assignment before the meeting. During every meeting, we have one person write a meeting minute to record what was discussed and take note of important information as well as the deadline for the group. After dividing tasks, we also supported each other if someone was stuck at anything. For example, when Hung was a little out of ideas for risks, we had sat down and discussed the possibility of risks when doing this app. During the time we worked together, all members have shown respect to each other and put effort into executing the project probably. Overall, it can be said that my group supported each other and worked well to finish this assignment.

To increase my possibility of success in job application, besides the fundamental marketing knowledge, I think it would be better if I know more about how the digital system works. To support the E-Commerce position of an E-Business and improve consumers' shopping experience, the way I reach out and communicate to them is crucial along with the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) has to be well-managed.

My second goal of achieving my dream is to get myself a job which allows me to gain access to data analytical skills, which could be data analyst. Finally, once I have taken a grasp of the real work flow of real life, which might take me half a year, I can build my own project of making an A.I-based model for analysing or predicting the flow of the market at high accuracy. Still, even in the worst case scenario where I could end up failing the project, I can still have my knowledge during my studies in RMIT to make games or applications and sell them according to people’s wishes.

            <p>
            Although we are all from different major, have different ideal jobs, we all want to learn IT as we acknowledge that in this modern world, especially in the 4.0 revolution, IT is a must to catch up with others and to support our career in the future as well. As can be seen through our ideal jobs, we want to study IT but more about the data. However, each of us will have different needs with different extent of knowledge regarding the IT field. Quynh wants to become a E-Commerce Manager in Digital Marketing which does not require much technical IT skills but data insights, how to optimise the available data to communicate with customers. Hung leans toward the privacy of data and systems while Thang wants to dive deeper into analysing data to and be able to serve in several perspectives such as business, finance, investment and so on. Apparently, Thang and Hung will have to be expertise in the IT field in order to achieve their dream jobs while Quynh can use it as a competitive advantage for her.
